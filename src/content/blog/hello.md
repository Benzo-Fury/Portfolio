# Why I Started This Blog (and What Iâ€™m Building)

Hey, Iâ€™m **Neo Haggard** ðŸ‘‹, a self-taught developer and IT professional from Australia who spends way too much time building things at the intersection of software, design, and security.  

This blog is my space to share what Iâ€™m working on, the problems I run into, and the lessons I learn along the way.  

## What Iâ€™m Building Right Now
- **Synta**: a local-first design tool that blends the feel of Figma with the power of code editors  
- **Inboxer**: an AI-driven Gmail automation platform for labeling, drafting, and managing email at scale  
- A handful of **Discord bots** that explore relationships, family trees, and quirky social features  
- Experiments in **cybersecurity** including proxy servers, local encryption protocols, and memory forensics  

## Why Write?
1. To **document my journey** so I can look back on it later  
2. To **share insights** with other builders whether itâ€™s debugging odd errors, structuring databases, or figuring out how to price projects as a freelancer  
3. To **connect with people** who care about the same stuff  

## What to Expect Here
- Deep dives into the **technical side** of my projects (TypeScript, Rust, Node, Neo4j, Mongo, and more)  
- Notes on **entrepreneurship** like funding, pricing, and building a brand as a young founder  
- Honest thoughts about **learning, failing, and iterating** in public  

Thanks for stopping by!  
If youâ€™re into tech, design, or cybersecurity experiments, youâ€™ll feel at home here. The next posts will get more hands-on, but I figured it was only fair to start with an introduction.  

*Neo*
